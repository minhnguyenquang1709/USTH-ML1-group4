# Football Match Prediction

## Introduction

Welcome to the Football Match Prediction project! This project aims to predict the outcomes of football matches using machine learning models. By leveraging historical match data, team rankings, and other relevant features, we aim to build models that can accurately forecast match results, providing valuable insights and predictions.

This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms. We employ models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict the match outcomes and compare their performance.

## Summary

In this project, we developed a robust pipeline for predicting football match results. The key steps involved are:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: 
   - We collected historical match data from various sources and merged them into a comprehensive dataset.
   - The data was cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values and converting categorical data into numerical form.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - We engineered features that are significant for predicting match outcomes, such as team rankings, total points, and historical performance.

3. **Model Training**:
   - We trained multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
   - We compared the performance of Logistic Regression and Random Forest, observing that Random Forest achieved higher accuracy.

5. **Predictions and Visualization**:
   - We implemented functions to make detailed single match predictions and visualize the results.
   - Confusion matrices were plotted to provide a clear understanding of model performance.

### Key Findings

- **Random Forest Model**: Achieved an accuracy of 95.114%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting match outcomes.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Achieved an accuracy of 55.652%, highlighting the need for more complex models in capturing the intricacies of match data.

### Future Work

- **Feature Expansion**: Incorporating additional features such as player statistics, recent form, and weather conditions could further improve prediction accuracy.
- **Advanced Models**: Exploring advanced machine learning and deep learning models to enhance predictive performance.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Implementing a real-time prediction system for upcoming matches based on live data updates.

By following this structured approach, we have built a solid foundation for predicting football match outcomes using machine learning. The results indicate that while simple models like Logistic Regression provide a baseline, more complex models such as Random Forest can significantly enhance prediction accuracy.
